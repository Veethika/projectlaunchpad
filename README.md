# Project Launchpad ðŸš€

the focus of project Launchpad to create an interactive game, playable through messengers (WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, etc) and a companion web app. The goal of Launchpad is to playfully educate and enable internet users to successfully monetize their creations on the web. It will allow players to assume the role of a creator/maker, construct a scenario for releasing their content and reaching out to their audience and pave their way into a successful monetization of their creations while competing with other players.
